## Introduction

Power outages can have significant economic and social impacts, affecting households, businesses, and essential services. Understanding the underlying causes of outages is crucial for improving power grid reliability and enabling quicker response times.

This project analyzes historical outage data (1540 rows Ã— 57 columns) to develop a model that predicts the cause of an outage based on factors like anomaly level, outage duration, climate region, and customer impact. By identifying patterns in the data, we can provide insights that help power companies take preventative measures and optimize resource allocation during disruptions.

The focus of this project is on the following question:
**"Developing a machine learning model that can predict outage causes based on real-time factors."**

This predictive capability could help power companies anticipate issues, allocate resources more effectively, and minimize disruption.
